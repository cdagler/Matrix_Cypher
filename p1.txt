What is Computer Science?

Computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice. It requires
thinking both in abstract terms and in concrete terms. The practical side of
computing can be seen everywhere. Nowadays, practically everyone is a computer
user, and many people are even computer programmers. Getting computers to do
what you want them to do requires intensive hands-on experience. But computer
science can be seen on a higher level, as a science of problem solving. Computer
scientists must be adept at modeling and analyzing problems. They must also be
able to design solutions and verify that they are correct. Problem solving
requires precision, creativity, and careful reasoning.

Computer science also has strong connections to other disciplines. Many problems
in science, engineering, health care, business, and other areas can be solved
effectively with computers, but finding a solution requires both computer
science expertise and knowledge of the particular application domain. Thus,
computer scientists often become proficient in other subjects.

Finally, computer science has a wide range of specialties. These include
computer architecture, software systems, graphics, artifical intelligence,
computational science, and software engineering. Drawing from a common core of
computer science knowledge, each specialty area focuses on particular
challenges.

Computer Science is practiced by mathematicians, scientists and engineers.
Mathematics, the origins of Computer Science, provides reason and logic. Science
provides the methodology for learning and refinement. Engineering provides the
techniques for building hardware and software.
